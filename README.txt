This .py-file is the code for a Neural Network that generates text after reading some input.
The code is written in Python, and you should run it rather on a GPU rather than on a CPU. It produces a file '

What do you need to to get it?
First, you need to install a Python environment, for example Anaconda. Here you can download Anaconda for your operating system:
https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python

Then, you need to install Keras and Tensorflow. These are Python packages with which you can setup and work with Neural Networks.
It can be a bit tricky to set up correctly, but there are good documentations for that:

Lastly, when everything works, you just need the text from Ulysses. Look no further, it is in this repository, too.
Just download it, put the file somewhere on your pc, and modify the path in the -py-file to that place.
I got this text from the amazing Project Gutenberg - a website that provides the full text of many books and poems.
This website provides a variety of other public available books as plain text.
Of course you don't need to use Ulysses for this - try out other texts and see what your graphics card makes with it!
